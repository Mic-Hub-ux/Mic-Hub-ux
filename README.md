## 🛠️ 3D Printer Mods & Custom Prints

I actively design and fabricate custom components to enhance both my 3D printer setup and real-world applications. This includes:

- 🔧 **Printer Upgrades**: Custom cooling ducts, cable chains, and structural improvements for improved performance and maintenance.
- 🗝️ **Keychains & Gadgets**: Functional and decorative keychains, everyday tools, and small utility items.
- 🏡 **Smart Garage Components**: Custom-designed guides and mounting brackets for a miniature motorized garage shutter, part of a smart home project.
- 🧵 **Sewing Accessories**: Tailored gadgets to assist with sewing tasks, such as spool holders and thread guides.
- 🧰 **Organizers**: Modular drawers and storage solutions for tools, components, and electronics.

Most parts were designed using Tinkercad and onShape on an Ender 3 S1 Pro. Some of the STL are available in the repository.
